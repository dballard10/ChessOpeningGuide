                    When you drag a piece, the move will appear in "Move

                  A chess opening refers to the initial moves of a chess game.
                  These first 10-15 moves often follow established patterns that
                  have been studied and refined over centuries of chess history.

                  Each opening has a name (like "Sicilian Defense" or "Queen's
                  Gambit") and follows specific move sequences. Learning these
                  patterns gives you a blueprint for starting games with
                  confidence.
